# A Locator is a command that locates objects of a given type.  Subclasses
# declare that they produce a given outputType (the type being located), and
# they provide a method for each input type that they can search for objects
# of this type.  Additionally, many locators are also PrettyPrinters, and can
# pretty print the things they find. There is some logic here to support that
# workflow.
